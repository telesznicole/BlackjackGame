# BlackjackGame
###### Created September 2019

This project implements a game of blackjack with refined rules.  The rules as described by the rubric for his project are as follows:<br>

<em>"A typical game will play out as follows:<br>
The player will be dealt one card at the start of the game (where a game is one round of play). The player, based on the value of his cards, can either ask for another card (a hit) or choose to hold (stand). The dealer will then begin his turn and try to beat the player’s hand. The player is competing against the dealer, who has his own hand. Whomever is closer to 21 at the end of the game (as long as they don’t exceed 21) wins the game.
1. Player’s turn: Player tries to reach or come close to 21 without going over (as 21 is the highest hand). 2. Dealer’s turn: Dealer tries to beat exceed the player’s hand without going over 21.
3. Determine the winner at the end of the game and increment the win count.
4. Repeat!"</em>
